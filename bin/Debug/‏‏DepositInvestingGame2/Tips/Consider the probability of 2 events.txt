- Consider the probability of 2 events -

Here's a "risk calculation" tip:

The probability of two events happening (let's call them A and B),
if (and only if!) when one of them occurs,
there's NO WAY the second will occur afterwards,
is the sum of the proabability of each of them - separately[1].

So for example,
if you bought a deposit,
the proabability that:

a. the bank will go bankrupt before the time span is due
b. you will receive the deposit with the full interest like you will be "supposed" to.

Is the sum of each of them happening separately.

Of course the example above isn't quite good, because it's obvious the sum of both of those events
should be 100% - as the 3rd option (that you will demand to get the deposit before the time span is due),
has no chance of happening unless you choose to make it happen (unless you're in the 'panic state').

But if you also play with calculations like "what is the chance I won't be able to wait enough..",
it should help.

And anyway, in general - if you are trying to calculate the proabability of each of them while you're playing,
you should use this to caculate it.
