== TIP ==

- Avoid the panic state -

Durning the game, your character might fall into a 'panic' state,
and when this happens, the rules will change temporarily.

It can happen if you have at least 2 deposits for a very long time (at least 5 years),
of course, only before the time span of all those deposits is due,
and overall, the ratio between 
the amount of money you have invested in deposits in the current game
and the overall amount of money you have (including the money you invested in the deposits)
is close in precentage to your 'risk profile'.

Why would that happen?
Because according to some psychologists, we humans hate losing stuff
much more than we like to gain staff that makes us happy. They call this "Loss aversion"[1].

In real life, in the stock market, there are investors who, when the value of the stuff they bought
(= the price they could sell them at) at the stock market was lower than the price they bought
them at,
yet they still choosed to sell them and lose money,
because they were afraid that the staff's value would only keep decreasing in the future.

And your character may feel the same kind of fear in this game.

And when that happens, as long as your character remains in this state,
you will not be able to buy any deposits.

Not only that, but your character will automatically want to release the riskiest
deposits you currently have. The results will be the same as the usual result
when you ask the bank to release a deposit before its time span is due[2].

This fits a concept in economics called "law of diminishing marginal utility".
According to it,
there's a limit to how much a product can help - at some point,
if one of its consumers keep buying more and more of it - it won't benefit him.
Afterall, eating 20 hamburgers a day proably isn't 20 times healthier
than eating 1 hamburger a day[3].

The 'product', in this case, is the deposit.
While investing is good and all, doing "too much" of it
can ruin your health out of fear.

The only way to avoid this is not to fall into this 'panic' state.

On a side note,
Maybe you also should
be carefull not to allow yourself to leave your deposits
"at risk" for years (in-game time) just because you aren't
sure if the bank will go bankrupt. Or something.

Because remember, you CAN know when the bank will go bankrupt,
at least as long as you are playing in time trial mode - 
just see when each of your deposits will be released,
and how much money each deposit is supposed to give you
by the time it's released.

state for 1 turn in a row,
because once you enter it,
you will instanyl release a deposit,
and that will get you out of the panic state.
