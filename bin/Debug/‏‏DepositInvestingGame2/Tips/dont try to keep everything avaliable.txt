- Don't try to keep everything available -

There are things in the game that can lock, or get lost.

For example, some deposits have a 'minimum money',
which the minimum amount of money you need to put in each of those,
to buy it.

Or when the bank goes bankrupt - then, any interest you could've
potentially gained from the deposits you had, is lost.

Or even when you have a deposit, whose "gap of months between exit points"
is 0 or any number besides 6 - it means you can't simply ask to release that deposit
in every turn as long as you own it.

This can be destructive:

- According to a research[1], where there was an expirement
with "door games" (where the goal was to earn as much money
as possible by the end, like in this game), the players sometimes
prefered options which were less profitable, but kept more options
available throught the game.

It seems that the players didn't even care what the cost of that is - 
they just wanted to avoid having less options at all costs.

By the way, I think this may be akin to the "loss aversion" of losing money
that was explained in 2 previous texts[2], as in both cases, it's about
people who make bad decisions just to reduce the risk of losing something
as much as possible.. "OH NO! I LOST IT! IT'S.. IT'S..."

- In another research[3], where 3 studies more done,
they found that when certain students had 6 choices rather than 24 or 30
(I think 'choices' were the amount of offered answers for each question
they had to answer, or.. somthin'...),
they had more satisfaction about the choices they made,
more motivation (for choclate?!),
and their answers were overall better (I hope they just meant
better grades).

OK I admit this research's pretty confusing, somewhat doubtful,
and it even says in the end
"Implications for future research are discussed", and this is
a (LOL) joke..

But I can't help but think that what they said about less choices
making students answer correctly more often at least matters,
if it doesn't neccesarily mean anything.

(I guess I also have this "loss aversion" problem - I would hate
to ignore this research just because I'm not sure that anything
can't be concluded from it)

Now that we talked about why keeping all options suck,
let's talk about what can cause you to want to keep all options open.

In some academic article[4], it's argued that
consumers who consider their options "closely"
feel "a sense of prefactual ownership of the choice options" - 
which results in them being afraid to choose anything,
because choosing an option feels to them like losing the other options.

So, he who thinks about his options too much.. Proably won't any option!

Also, what that article calls "close consideration" may also be called "analysis" -
since there is something called "Analysis paralysis",
which describes a state of doing nothing due to thinking too much[5].

So the bottom line is: don't try to avoid being unable to buy certain deposits,
or risking the bank going bankrupt, or being unable to release certain deposits
you may own.

Those don't neccesarily mean anything bad in themselves.
Maybe you're doing well anyway.

And of course, in order to avoid feeling pointlessy afraid to lose those options,
just avoid considering too many things at each of your turn.

Adopting clear strategies for a whole game (rather than improvising
and thinking for the short-term of 2-3 years of in-game time at most),
can help you make decisions more easily.
