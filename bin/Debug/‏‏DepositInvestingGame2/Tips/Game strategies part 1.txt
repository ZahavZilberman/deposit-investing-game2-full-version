- Strategies for the game, part 1 -

Well, now that you've beaten the 1st level..

It's important to realize that deposits with
higher default interest will produce you more money
for the same mount of money in deposits with lower default deposits,
which means they will sometimes be more worthy at a early time
of every game.. and sometimes not.

after all, in the begging, you have much time left
until you can finish the game, so when
there's plenty of time, there's plenty of interest to get later.

But be carefull for 2 things:

a. Panic mode - if you have 2 long term deposits
(their time spans are both > 5 years), you will get into this state,
and the riskiest of them ( = the most profitable one) will have to be released
automatically (even if it happens at a date where the riskiest deposit normally
cannot be released).

b. depsoits with way-too-long term. Let's illustrate this with an example:

Say you're playing the game where you start with 0 dollars,
earn 1000 per turn and need to save 20,000 dollars to finish.

If you could wait evey turn and do nothing, you would win after
(20,0000 / 1,000) = 20 turns, meaning you would finish at
(year 11, month 1) [call this "Janaury 11"], with excatly 20,000 dollars.

But if you could wait for 10 turns
(until "Janaury 6") and then buy the
deposit with the time span of 9 years,
it will be released after (9 * 2 = 18) turns,
which is only at "January 15"!

In which case, you would've been better off doing nothing the whole game..

And if you released that deposit any earlier than "January 15",
you would have to ask the bank to release it,
resulting not only in the interest of the deposit being lower
because of the shorter time it "lived",
but also in the bank mulcting you with 50% of the deposit's (lower) interest.

So be careful with investing in deposits in situations where it may've
been better to buy deposits with much shorter time spans,
so that they'll be released (without any mulcts) before you will
finish a game, and then finish it with a better score!
