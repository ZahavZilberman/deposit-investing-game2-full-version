- Strategies for the game, part 3 -

In some games, if you adopt the strategy
from the previous tip,
consider that the following can happen:

Like I said in part 2 of the game strategies tips,
the bank may go bankrupt at some point if you earn enough
money for that.

And that leads to a strategy that is based on an expectation.

Expectation about the amount of times
you expect the bank to go bankrupt throught a "good" game - 
until you finish the game.

Here's an example. If you buy a couple of deposits, and then they get released
at a certain date and the bank goes bankrupt,
it's possible that if you then set another date for getting multiplie deposits
released automatically, the bank will go bankrupt AGAIN.

This is what happened to me at the level where you need to reach 20,000 dollars.

And in more diffcult games, it can strech so the bank go bankrupt
3 times in a game. Or 4. Or 5. And so on.

Adopting the strategy from the previous tip is also good,
because remember that when a bank goes bankrupt - 
all of the deposits you had are released with no interest.

And when you adopt this strategy, you get most or all
of them released with their interest right BEFORE the bank goes bankrupt,
so that the bankruptcy won't cause any damage.

At games when that can happen, it's recommended to:

a. Figure the amount of times a bank can go bankrupt.

b. Find via trial and error - the earliest date you can make
the bank go bankrupt at the 1st time, and the earliest date
for the 2nd time, etc.

c. At the game, adopt the strategy from the part 2 tip multiplie times in 1 game.
Set all the dates based on at what in-game date the bank will go bankrupt each time,
and then, as explained in the part 2 tip, buy as many deposits as possible
(with 1 turn of doing nothing between each buy), until each of those dates.
