- Deposits -

Let's talk about deposits and the relationship between them in this game,
and in real life.

Generally, the way deposits work in real life may differ from bank to bank.
The way they work in this game certainly isn't 100% realistic.

The way any deposit in this game works is generally the same as
one type of real life deposits known as "Time deposit" or "Term deposit"[1]

Here are some key differences between deposits in the game, and in real life:

- In real life, the shortest time span for a deposit isn't 1 year.
There are deposits for months and even weeks.

In my bank, those deposits have a "default" interest of something like..
maybe 0.1% a year (on averge).

- The gaps of the interests of the deposits in this game isn't
neccesarily "binding". The gaps between deposits interests
can be very different in real life from this game.

- In real life, even if you release the deposit at the predetermined time,
the bank may not pay all the deposit with the full interest - 
he may force you to pay for "taxes". [2]

I don't know why banks can have the right to do that and how it works,
which is why no bank ever does this in this game.

- Also, deposits in real life can also have really (..) names,
like those in the game.
such as "Tooth fairy".  (Just kidding)

- Real life deposit may also have a detail called "exit point".
This is basically a/the point in which the bank will be willing to release the deposit
if the customer asks him to.

A deposit may have one more exit points, and it may not have any exit points at all.

For example, in this game,
all deposits are as if they all have an "exit point" every 6 months,
but using that exit point will cause tha bank to mulct you
(I'm not sure if real life banks mulct for releasing a deposit at an exit point).

- And as a reminder, there's the fact that interests may not be offered
as "fixed rate deposit" (deposits whose interests are pre-determined
and can't change with time, and this is the only deposit type that exists
in this game).

- In real life, when a cilent of a bank asks to release his deposit
before its time span is due,
he may receive what's called "Early Repayment Fee",
while this game simply refers to this as the bank mulcting the cilent.

And while in the game, the bank always "mulcts" the cilent
by simply calculating this:

[(the interest of the deposit per year) * (the amount of time that passed between
the time the cilent bought the deposit and the time it was released)] / 2.

While in real life, I found that in some places, the bank calculates the
"early repayment fee" like this[3]:

[(The amount of money the bank avoided paying thanks to the early release)
/ (1 + the deposit's interest per "time period"] + [1 / (1 + the deposit's interest per "time period")
 ^ (the amount of years that the cilent had the deposit)],

and then you subtract all of that into some simliar equation I failed to understand.
Understood nothing? Well done, because that's excatly why I didn't use this formula
to caculate this for the game.

- Other types of deposits include:

a. "CPI-linked".

From what I know, this means the interest will increase and decrease
throught time depending on the changes in the CPI (Consumer Price Index),
which, in other words, is the inflation or deflation of the economy the CPI is of[4].

So generally speaking, this means that if a country's economy grows massivly
within a year, chances are, investing in a "CPI-linked" deposit in that year
would bring much higher interest than investing in a fixed deposit in that same year
(assuming the same amount of money is put on both of them, for only that year,
and without the "Early repayment", which is asking to release a deposit before its
time span is due).

In addition, some real life banks may offer those deposits with a promise for
"Floor index" - which can be described as the following:
"If the CPI decreases overall in the whole time period that the deposit
was locked, the investor will receive all the money he put in the deposit
without losing anything".

b. Foreign currency deposit.

Every coin has a value compared to other coins - dollar, euro, etc.
This is a deposit that its interest depends, at least among other things,
on the interest of the coin it is "managed" on, which is a coin
that isn't the one that is usually used in the country the deposit
is offered in.

(This still doesn't describe everything about it works, but that's all I know).

c. Foreign currency indexed deposit.

Simliar to the 'Foreign currency' type. I'm not sure what's
the difference/s between them..

d. Variable interest deposits.

Those are deposits whose interest varies with time,
just like all the previous deposits types (a-c),
but instead of their changes being based on an index,
they're based on something called "Prime rate",
which is some kind of "default interest rate" some banks
may use to determine the interest of many deposits and loans
they offer[5].

(Notes:

1. Another helpfull definition for deposit types is "Short term deposit".
Those are basically all the deposits whose time span is less than a year[6],
and as a reminder, they're not allowed to exist in this game.

2. Some banks may offer "unique" deposits, that are "fusions"
of 2 or more types of other deposits.
For example, one of them has a timespan of 2 years.
However, its interest after 1 year equals a certain fixed-rate interest,
but its interest calculated for the 2nd year equals a certain variable interest.)
