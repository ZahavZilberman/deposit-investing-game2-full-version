- Placebo and other manipulations -

Hey, look, I know you might think you know yourself well and all that,
but you might be surpirsed how irrational our decisions can be.

Here are some examples:

1.
One research[1] found that there can be a correlation between the price
that we pay for a certain product, and the benefit we gain from it
(the more we pay, the more benefit we get), and that's not
neccesarily because of the product itself, but because
of our possible expectation that the more we pay, the more we get.

Expectations can create reality, without us knowing.
This phenomenon is called "the placebo effect"[2] - 
when something (the better benefit) happens,
but not because of why it was supposed to (better product),
but because of something unrelated (expectations).

Fortunately, in this game, nothing is really luck-based anyway,
well, unless you CHOOSE to depend on luck rather than calculations,
I guess.. ^^

2.
Confirmation bias, which is the tendency to focus on confirming
what you already belive[3], is also relevant in this regard - 
if you belive that you it's always best, at any game,
to avoid at all cost having the bank going bankrupt - 

then you will proably find reasons why it has to be true
("Canceling deposits risks my 'game mentality'!" "It's just annoying!"),
even thought in this game, in some games, you can
finish with much better scores if you purposelly make the bank
go bankrupt in the earliest time possible.

3. See in the tip "Don't copy from other players",
about social norms..

Footnotes:

[1] It's a research which tested 2 groups, which received the same
product, one with a higher price than the other, and then tested
the (averge) benefit each group received from that product.

You can find it in Google Scholar by searching:

[2] The "Oxford Dictionaries" website defines placebo as:
"A medicine or procedure prescribed for the psychological benefit to the patient rather than for any physiological effect." - 
So in this regard, the "treatement" is whatever caused the expectations to rise, and the effect is the better benefit
from the more expensive product.

[3] Wikipedia defines confirmation bias as:
"is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information
in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses"
