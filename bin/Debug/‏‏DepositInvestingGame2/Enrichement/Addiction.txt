- Addiction -

What if I told you that the ultimate way to make money
is to get (and never stop being) **addicted** to an activity
people may or will pay you to do?

Well, let's say that part of this is very close to what I really think,
and here's why.

Let's start with a definition for addiction based on several researches and books:

"Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli,
despite adverse consequences"[1].

I think, based on this, that addiction means to "want something, but also want not to want it."

It's important to note that sometimes, people may define other people as "addicted",
when they actually mean that they're addicted in their eyes only.

Because the person they consider "addicted" may not mind playing video games 12 hours a day,
but others will call him "addicted" because simply because **they** don't want him to play
video games so much, while they realize he does it because he wants to.

But if the "addicted" person also agrees that what he's doing is "wrong",
then he's addicted in his eyes as well.

However, there's no such thing as being addicted "objectively".
It's all in a person's (or organization, doesn't matter) eyes,
regardless of if he/it's judging himself/itself as addicted,
or not.

I also note that I won't address the following aspects about addiction:

a. Whatever it's the addicted person causing himself to get addicted
(possibly due to boredom and/or a million other reasons),
or that what he's addicted to was designed to be addictive and have rewarding stimuli?

b. The fact that video game addiction is not considered to exist
(= to have sufficient evidence to be considered to exist)[2].

So, let's concentrate.
Say you're a man working 14 hours a day, 7 days a week,
to start a business. You basically don't think of anything else.
You even cut your sleep time to 7 hours or less just to work more.

In that example, are you addicted? You know, to working on that business?

Afterall, if you were a child playing video games 14 hours a day, you proably would've
been considered addicted by your parents.

But if you're working so much to earn money, while managing to take care of your health,
some people may think you're not addicted,
because you have no reason to "want to stop wanting to work on the business",
or, in other words,
no reason to hate the fact that you're engaging in this single activity for so long.

Because while playing games may be always considered "non-productive",
working to build a business to make money is "productive", right?

And if it's "productive", it's "important", right?

And I think, that people who think this, proably won't have a problem to say something like:

"If you want to make a business, it is best to get addicted into working on it,
to build it as fast as possible".

In other words, they would say that this specific addiction is **good**,
for those who want to make a business.

Yes, addiction can cause health problems and even death[3],
but engaging constantly in a single activity without being addicted to it
( = wanting to want to engage in it for so long),
which is clearly NOT being addicted,
can cause the same things.

To summarize,
if you want to make money making up a business,
depending on your strategies and personal preferences and values,
you may be better off getting addicted to that.

Howeve, personal advice: You'd proably not be better off get addicted into investements
like deposits.

Deposits LOCK. For long weeks/months/years. You can't get "addicted" to them
without constantly trying to release them every day or something. And that better not happen.
