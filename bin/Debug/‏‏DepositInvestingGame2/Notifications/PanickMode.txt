== Notification ==

You're now in the "panick" state..

Because of you risking (locking) so much of your money
(less than 5% less than the risk profile for this game),
and investing in at least 2 highly risky deposit (with a time span of at least 5 years each),

the game's invisiable cheater asshole which does stuff that makes no sense had made you panicked.

This means you will automtically (without actually choosing it) try to release your riskiest deposit!

By the way, this notification can appear more than one turn in a row,
depending on your status in each turn.

It will only stop appearing when you get out of this state,
by releasing enough deposits.
