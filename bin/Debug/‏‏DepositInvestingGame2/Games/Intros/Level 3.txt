== Introduction to this test ==

Again, your choices expand and the game's much longer,
but this time, you'll also start from 0 dollars,
will have to wait a lot before you can buy much of the
offered deposits,
and releasing the deposits by yourself may often be
unallowed..

"Bastard" best score in this test is finishing it at:
year 10, month 7, with 20,500 dollars.

(So you must either finish at "july 10" with over 20,500 dollars,
or finish before that with any amount of dollars).
