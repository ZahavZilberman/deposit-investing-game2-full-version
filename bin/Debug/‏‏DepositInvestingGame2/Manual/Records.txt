== Records ==

In all game modes, the goal is generally to earn a certain amount of money as fast as possible.

This means that any actual acheivement in this game is time-based.

Once someone wins in this game, he has a record:
The amount of game-time that passed until he won, considering his risk profile.

You may save your records that will be saved into a 'high score' list.

Every high score list refers to all games made with one specific setting (a game).

Reminder: games may differ form one another with the amount of money needed in order to finish the game,
as less money needed means the times will be faster,
and maybe also in the deposits that are aviliable to the player/s in the bank's deposits board,
which can make a big difference as well,
the amount of money all players start the game with,
and each of their "risk profiles".
Also, each score may be done in a different mode, which matters too.

It would not be fair to only have one single high score list for all games.

However, sometimes multiplie records may look equal (have the same month and year times),
but actually, 1 of them would be better than the others,
simply because it was reached with more saved money than in the other records.

When you finish the "Level 3" game, for example,
you may reach it multiplie times at year 10, month 7.
But at the 1st time, you had 600 unneccesary (more than you needed) dollars when you finished.
And at the 2nd time, you had 300 unneccesary dollars.

At the above example, the 1st record is better than the 2nd,
because he had more money remaining,
which "collides" with the aim of making as much money as possible as fast as possible.

It's the same in multiplayer mode - even if both players
 finish the game at the same date, but one of them has more money left when winning,
he won the game.

Keep this in mind.
