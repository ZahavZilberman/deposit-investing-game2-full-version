== Gameplay - part 1 ==

When you play in either game mode, here are some key points to understand the gameplay:

- The game in general is turn-based. Each turn is for half a year (game-time only).

- Your income is pre-determined by a game.
It does not have any "condition" that detemines it - 
it varies from game to game,
so you can know it from viewing a game's details
(or seeing how much money you earn at a turn by doing nothing).

There are no expenses.

This is because this game is about earning money by investing. I don't want to complicate
the game so much more by allowing the player to also affect his expenses and revenues.

- When the time span of a deposit you bought is due, you will most likely
receive automatically a sum of money that equals the entire deposit
with the interest you are supposed to get for it,
in which case the money will be in your uninvested savings.

If that doesn't happen when the timespan of a desposit is due, the game
will inform you about that.

- Generally, in every turn, you have 3 basic courses of action you can take:

a. Buy a deposit of your choice (by choosing one from the list of the game's deposits).

b. Order the bank to release your deposit for you, even thought the time span is not due yet.

c. Do nothing (wait).

- To finish each of your turn, you must choose one of the 3 actions shown above.

- In each of your turns,
You may also save your game, and/or return to the main meun,
and/or view the details of the bank and all its deposits in the "bank board",
and/or your player details, and/or the current game's details.

- You can't do nothing for more than 3 turns in a row.

In real life, if you were in this situation, you wouldn't want to spend
so much time buying deposits and then doing nothing,
because you may feel bored. Very bored. Thirsty for some sort of cognitive stimulation.
So that's why it's like this.

- The minimum amount of money you need to be allowed to buy a deposit,
is the minimum amount defined for it divided by your risk profile.
Example: If your risk profile is 80% and your savings are 500 dollars,
you will be able to put at max 400 dollars to the deposit - 
so if the minimum for the deposit above 400,
you won't be allowed to buy the deposit.

- When you ask the bank to release a deposit - it doesn't have to agree.
Whatever he agrees or not depends on a condition of the deposit called "exit points" - 
which are the dates when a deposit can be released before its time span is due,
once you bought it.

Every deposit has a property for that, called "gap of months between each exit point".
This is the gap of months between each exit point, with the 1st exit point being right after
you bought at the deposit, and the final one being right at or before the time span
of the deposit will be due.

So, if a deposit's time span is 1 (year), it's bought at Janaury 2010 
and its "gap of months for exit points" is 6 months,
you could ask the bank to release it (and he'll accept) on July 2010
and January 2011.
If that deposit's "gap of months" was 0, it means it has no exit points - 
it'll only release once its time span is due, by the bank only.

- if the bank has finicial diffculties in returing you the deposit when it gets released,

which can happen whatever when your deposit gets released when the time span is due,
or before that time - but NOT when you buy a deposit,

the bank will go bankrupt and close.
What will happen then is:

1. The bank that goes bankrupt will automatically give you all the money it has left
(in addition to the money of the deposit without interest)

2. a "new" bank will automatically be created
and all players will become clients of the "new" bank.

3. The rest of your deposits will be released automatically with
no interest at all.

The "new" bank's sum of money and deposits will equal those of the bank
that went bankrupt when it was created (at the start of the game).
