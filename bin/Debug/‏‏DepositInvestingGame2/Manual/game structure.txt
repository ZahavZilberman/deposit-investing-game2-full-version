== Game Structure ==

Now that you're famliar with the material you better know for the game,
let's explain the game itself.

- The game has the following "gameplay included" modes:

a. Time trial - You race alone (with no enemies) to get a certain
amount of money as fast as possible.

b. Multiplayer - You race against another human player (not against the computer)
to get a certain amount of money before him.

- About your status:

In each mode,
you need to be assigned certain properties for any game beofore you play it.

1 property, that you cannot set yourself, is the risk profile.
(If you don't know what that means, go read about risks in investing again)

The risk profile is merely the answer to 1 simple question:

"What is the maximum precentage of my savings I can risk?"

Yes, because in the game, you'll be investing. and Investing requires taking risks.
So, how much of your money you willing to risk? 10%? 30%?

The higher the precentage, the faster you will progress in the game.
Because the precentage's meaning in the gameplay is simple:

if you dare to try to invest an amount of money (out of your savings that aren't invested)
that its precentage out of your uninvested savings is bigger than your risk profile",

the game simply won't let you. You will not be allowed to invest that amount of money
at that point.

You can adjust the risk profile only by creating a game.
Otherwise it will be set for you in each game.

- Each game may differ from another game with:

a. The amount of money a player must get to finish the game
b. The deposits boughtable in the game (in their names, timespan, default interests,
minimum amout of money required to buy each of them, and the "exit points gap in months"
which will be explained later)
c. The amount of money the player/s start the game with
d. The bank's name
e. Risk profile
f. Game name
g. The income of every player between each turn
h. The amount of money the bank starts with

(Every single one of those will be addressed later in this manual)

- The game has some built-in games,
while their name is their diffculty level (in relative to each other).
But if you want more,
you can create your own games by choosing
the option of creating a game via the main meun.

There, you will have to input all the details from the previous section
in this text.

(Note: Durning the part of inputing the deposits, the game
will simply ask you when if you're done with them every
time you finish entering a deposit. Be ready for that).

- There are various tips and enrichments in this game.

Tips are there to help you play, improve and win
in the actual games, giving tips about the gameplay,
sometimes even "deeping" into certain aspects of it
more than the manual does.

Enrichments are there to help you understand
how all the details of this game relate to real life-investing,
espically investing in deposits (obviously),

as well to throw some not-so-related aspects about personal finance
and economy in general,
because the game's developer figured it would be less boring
to make this game by adding them (....)

When you open the game for the 1st time,
you will not be able to read any tip or enrichment.

But each time you finish one out of the "built-in" games(levels)
in time trial mode,
you MAY unlock some tips and enrichments and be able to read them
(when you unlock them, and/or by choosing to read tips/enrichments
from the main meun),
if your score beats that of "Bastard".

"Bastard"'s score is mentioned at the introduction to each "built-in" game(level)
in time trial mode.
