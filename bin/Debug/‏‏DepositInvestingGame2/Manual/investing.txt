Let's talk now about investing in general.

Investing is the act of buying something for the sake of earning more money in the future.

It can be done by a single person or an organization.

Generally speaking, we can earn money by investing in at least 2 ways:

a. Buying something and then selling it later at a higher price.
b. Buying something and then getting paid for something that you can get paid for
BECAUSE of you owing that something. It can be an apartment (rent), stock (dividend), etc.

Now, since depositing deposits to a bank is basically like giving him a loan, earning money
from deposits is like earning money like in the (b) option - 
you "buy" a deposit and owing a deposit gives you the right to enjoy
earning money from a predetermined interest later.

However, investing always involves taking risks. Because when you're investing,
you're choosing to waste money on something, in hopes that your investement plan
(that involved this purchase) will pay off enough so that you will earn more money
than you spent in this investement.

But this doesn't always happen. People who invest in the stock market, for example may give up and sell
everything they bought there even they knew they are going to sell what they bought at a lower price,
and thus, lose money.

Investing in general is a "calculated risk". You know you may lose money, so you build a plan
that you hope will work for you.

Because of that, when people invest in something, they may plan this by calculating risks:

- They may think about all the possible risks in investing in what they want to invest at.
- They may think about what part of their overall savings they can lose without losing their mental health (or something like that).
- They can limit the risks they're willing to take based on their answer to the previous section.
- They're comparing the things they think of investing at and try to think which has the best "ratio" - 
the ration between potential or expected earnings (also called "yields", that are measured in precentage)
and between the "size" of the risks of the buying neccesary for those earnings.
