== Risks ==

As said beforehand, this is an investing game, and any investement invloves risk.

Let's talk about common risks invloved in investing by buying deposits, which exist in real life as well as in the game:

- The possibility that you will decide to order the bank to release your deposite before the timespan is due.

This is risky, because you don't know what will happen if you choose to do that. The bank can mulct you,
and who knows how limited he is at doing that (if even at all). He can refuse. And maybe there are more options.

Bottom line: This possibility is a risk because the outcome is unknown completely. And whatever the case will be,
if this possibility happens, you are likely to at least earn less money than you would have if you waited like a good kid
(lol) until the time span would be due.

- The possibility that the bank will go bankrupt when the time span would be due.

Just like the bank may allow you to receive at least part of the deposit before the time span is due,
you may find yourself "forced" to allow him to do the opposite - not to return to you the full deposit
when the time span is due.

Yes, this can happen to organizations. This is known to happen in the stock market,
when investors buy bonds of companies, which are basically loans - they give the companies
money and the companies are obligated to return the money with interest to them,
but when the time to do that arrives, they just can't.

Of course, your case here is the same - the bank HAS to return the deposit with the promised interest to you.
There's no "permanent escape" from this for the bank.
However, the bank's money, just like yours - is limited.

Before I continue, it's important to note that:

1. Since the bank going bankrupt is a result of money that it doesn't have,
generally speaking, the less money you use to "buy deposits",
and the shorter the time span of the deposit you buy,
the less likely the bank is to go bankrupt when the deposit gets released.

2. The longer the time span of the deposit is, the higher chance there is
that the bank will go bankrupt by the time the time span will be due.
That's part of the price of a longer-term deposit.
