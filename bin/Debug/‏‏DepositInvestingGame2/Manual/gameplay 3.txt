== Gameplay - part 3 ==

Now that we've covered the actual gameplay, let's dig deeper into deposits and the offers of the bank for them.

Let's start by talking about the deposit's board:

- First and foremost, all the offers to the deposits will appear in a single "bank board" that will be able to choose to view
and by deposits from in every single turn (other than the turns when your character will enter "panic mode").

- If you're playing a game with 2 players or more (human or not),
all players only have 1 board of deposits they can buy deposits from.
This means that when one of them buys a deposit, the deposit wil not be aviliabe
to the other players (althought they will know who bought every deposit).

- Every deposit will be offered with a different time span, and the interest for all the deposit
(disregarding their time span) will also differ in accordance with the time span, and will increase/decrease along with the time span.

Now, about let's mention several important stuff about deposits in general:

- To know to separate between all the deposits,
each of them will be given a name.

- If the deposit belongs to a player,
the board will state which player the deposit belongs to.

- There are 3 different "ranks" for the interest of every deposit.
And the rank each deposit you "buy" will have depends on 2 factors:

a. The amount of money one of the players must reach to finish the game
b. The amount of money you put in the deposit.

The "rank" your deposit will get will depend on the ratio between those 2 amounts.
Let's break this down:

"Rank 1" - if the amount of money you "buy" the deposit with is less than 10%
than the amount of money you need to get to finish the game,
it will receive this rank.

"Rank 2" - if the money you put in the deposit is between 10 - 25%
of the "game finished" money you need,
it will receive this rank.

"Rank 3" - if the money you put is anything more than 25%
of the "game finished" money, it's this.

- The "default" interest of a deposit will depend on its time span.
So yeah, deposits for longer time will also (in theroy) give you a higher interest every year.

Generally, the "default" interest for a deposit can range anywhere from 0.1% to 10%. Deposits for the shortest term
The longer the deposit's time span, the higher his interest will be per year.
This "defualt" interest is based on those deposits being "rank 1".
If they're rank 2, they will "added" with their sqrt.
and if they're rank 3, they will rise to the power of 2.

- The time spans of the deposits the bank will offer will generally range
from 1 year to maybe 9 years.

- The minimum amount of money required to buy each deposit depends on how high
its default interest and timespan are.

- Notice that while you can view the deposit's themselves from many "positions"
in the game,
the only way to view it while also being able to access every deposit's full details
(by writing a deposit's name there), is on the bank board.
