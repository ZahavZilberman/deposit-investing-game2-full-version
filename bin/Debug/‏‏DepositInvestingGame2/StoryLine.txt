== Storyline ==

Hey, just for the game's intro..

Here's the "storyline" of this game:

You live in a family addicted to video games.
Most of your family memebers, by today,
live on the streets,
because they spent too much money on games
and PC upgrades.

Appearntly some smartass named "Smartass"
is the sole developer who made all of those games they bought,
designing them from the ground to be as addictive as possible,
and guess what he does with all that money he earned from them?

Why, investing in deposits, of course!
He likes the banking system, appearntly,
so much that he actually decided a few months ago
to apply for a job in a bank.

Now that you (somehow..) found out
that he recently found a job really suited for him,
you decide to try and prevent him from getting that job,
by getting it yourself, as it suits you also anyway.

So, you apply for the same job,
and your are requested to pass a bunch of tests - 
"scenarios" of investing for years in each scenario.

"Bastard" has already done those tests - 
his scores are what you need to beat in order to win.

So, beat his scores, prevent from getting that job,
and avenge his ***.

Of course, even if you succeed,
he'll proably somehow avenge again..
But I bet you don't care anyway.

The tests are every game in time trial mode.
Everything else is just bonuses.

Good luck.
