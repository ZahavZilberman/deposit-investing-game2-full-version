- Strategies for the game, part 2 -

Here's a possible strategy (consisting of steps) for how to manage the deposits you buy:

1. Before buying any deposit,
set up a date for which you want to get the largest
interest possible before either the bank goes bankrupt
or you finish the level.

2. From the game start until the date you've set,
buy as many deposits as possible, while making
sure that the date you've bought them at - 
assures that all of them will be automatically released
at the date you've set up in the previous step.

However, make sure not to buy a deposit every turn,
but to do nothing for 1 turn between each deposit you buy - 
so that you'll have a worthy amount of money to put in each deposit,
and also because deposits with different time spans must be
bought at least 1 year after/before, in order for them to be released
automatically at the same date.

Keep doing that until the date you set up arrives.
Once it arrives, you should receive all the deposits
you bought from the start of the game.

And when that happens, you will earn tons of money,
possibly finishing the game at this date and/or
causing the bank to go bankrupt.

3. Now, regardless of if the bank went bankrupt or not
at the end of step no.2,
you may want to buy 1 or more deposits
to earn as much as you can before either the game is finished,
or until the earliest date the bank can go bankrupt again.

It's recommended to choose 1 option out of the following:

a. Buy the deposit with the longest time span (that you can afford),
and release it at the turn that you expect to finish the game at.

b. Buy the deposit whose time span is the closest to the gap
between the current date and the date you expect to finish
the game at (and that you can afford),
so that it'll be automatically released right before the game is finished.

Now, for the sake of arguement, let's assume that you will have (at the date you
set at step no.1) enough money to buy each deposit from both those options,
and assume each of the deposits can be released every turn after they're bought
(= every 6 months).

In which case, option (a) is better if the interest (per year) of the deposit it refers
to is bigger than the interest of the deposit option (b) refers to,
if its interest (when risen to the power of 2) is higher
than the interest of the deposit from option (b),
since you can only put the same amount of money in each option,
and the interest from the deposit (a) will "get mulcted" by 50%
due to the early release.
