- Dont fall to the gambler fallacy -

There's a logical fallacy called "The gambler's fallacy".

This fallacy is in arguements that state that since an event happened in a certain time period less than averge,
in the next equal time period, it will happen more than averge,
As well as the opposite - the belief that since an event happened in a certain time period more than averge,
in the next equal time period, it will happen less than averge[1].

If you don't know what a "logical fallacy" is, no matter. Just think of
arguements having this fallacy as "wrong reasoning"[2].

However, in this tip, I won't refer to this fallacy directly - 
I'm going to refer to the general thought that the probability of a random event to occur
changes following random events that happened before him.

The reason is simple: a random event cannot have any reason. Since it's random,
than it has, by definition, no reason that can make it more or less likely.

This is related to a logical fallacy known as "Post hoc ergo propter hoc" - 
that exists in arguements that argue that since an event (say 'A') happened right before
another event (say 'B'), then A is the reason for B[3].

Just because you fall into the panic mode right after buying a certain deposit,
it doesn't mean you would'nt if you bought any other available deposit.

In Investing, the chance to succed in general is random, but only to some extent.

"Investements" that their proabability to succed is 100% random, are known as "gambles".

So in this game, if the bank goes bankrupt - that's random yes, but not completely - 
it is also because of the deposits you bought.

If. say,  a computer buys a deposit and thus prevents you from buying it, yes, you cannot control the AI - 
but does not change the fact that it would not have happened if you bought the deposit before him.

And so on. The bottom line is that you should be carefull to separate correctly between random events with no certainity whatsoever - 
and events that their result IS certain,
as well as when 2 events in the game are connected (connected = one of them is the/a reason of the other),
and when they're not.
