- Think relative instead of absloute -

Here's a tool about how to think about money in general.

You can think about money in an "absloute" way:

that 20 dollars are worth more than 10 dollars
the same way 12,010 are worth more than 12,000 dollars.

But when we measure how **important** is the gap between
2 amounts of money, it may be better to think about money in a "relative" way.
This means to think of the example from the previous paragraph like this:

20 dollars are worth 2 times (20 / 10) as much as 10 dollars
12,010 dollar are worth 1.0008 (12,010 / 12,000) times as much as 12,000 dollars.

Afterall, if you can even CONSIDER buying something that costs 12,000 dollars,
chances are, 10 dollars are a very small part of your money, so you may not care 
about such a gap in that case.

But if you are wondering if to buy in 20 or 10 dollars and nothing more expensive than that,
chances are, 10 dollars is a big part of your money.

But if you're planning for the long term - 10 dollars may be worth saving regardless of
how much money you have right now.

Remember this while playing the game. Think about what part of the money you're thinking
to put in deposit/s is of your overall savings. This could matter more than its amount compared
to the amount of money you need to save to finish the game.
