- Don't copy from other players -

While you're playing the game, you may find yourself
watching other players playing, seeing the strategies
they adopt..

My advice in this regard is simple: Don't copy their strategies,
for the same reason you should'nt mindlessly follow every social norm.

Let me explain why, with some evidence..

I don't know if this is because
we humans stil have a bit of the stupidity we used to have
when we were monkeys or something,
but it seems that the majority opinion can badly influence
our opinion.. Or at least what we may express about our opinion.

A research[1] took a bunch of females,
showed them blue slides, and asked a certain amount of
other females to claim to everyone that the slides are actually green
(before the other females answered) - sometimes it was most of the
participants in the expirement, sometimes only few.

And guess what? Many more females who were asked what the color the slide was
(when it was obviously blue) - stated that it was green, not because they were asked to,
but appearntly because that was the majority opinion that was presented to them - 
rather than when the majority opinion presented to them was that the slide was blue.

This phenomenon of adopting the majority opinion may be called
"the bandwagon effect"[2].

That is why I would never suggest anyone to adopt strategies for this game based on
the strategies he may see other players adopting.
(Why don't you instead learn from the tips the game's creator put in it,
for example? There even some tips for strategies..) ^^

[2] Wikipedia defines the bandwagon effect as:
"a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas,
fads and trends increases the more that they have already been adopted by others."
