- Build self discpline -

Imagine this situation:
You're playing against somene else in multiplayer mode,
and you have many deposits, even more than him,
but then the bank goes bankrupt
in the other player's turn - in your next turn, you might feel
over-mega-super-hyper pissed off.

This situation was already brought up in a previous tip
(about 'evaulting risk profile'),
in which I addressed how dangerous it can be to
'act from emotion'.

This is espcally important, as those actions can actually form
into habits that will influence your future deicisions[5].

In this tip, I will further explain how to avoid
acting from emotion in those situations.

Generally speaking, self discpline is about regulating
your own behaviour by sticking "laws" to it[1] - 
like "go to sleep at 11:00 pm every day".

It is associated with sacrificing short-term benefits
for long-term benefits[2],
so it can be diffcult and annoying to do.

Stil, there are things you can try to do it.
Here are some:

1. Use heuristics - those are "rules of thumb" for
making certain decisions in certain situations that will
be sufficient to get what you want in those situations[3].

Those "rules of thumb" can help you avoid making a dumb decision
even when you're passionate (really want)[4] to make that dumb decision.

So, an example of a "rule of thumb" that's super revelant to the example
brought before, is to decide to:
"never avenge another player when he causes the bank to go bankrupt".

Indeed, my boy! Avenging him is not likely gonna be the decision
that will give you the most money until the end of the game..
So this rule of thumb can be very usefull!

2. Write a contract with yourself.

You can adopt a certain investing strategy,
like "Buy or sell a deposit each turn",
and stick to it at all costs by writing it
on a contract.

That will also restrict your ability to
make quick and unplanned decisions
due to unexpected events.

Footnotes:

[1] Based on the Wikipedia article about "Discpline",
which defines discpline as regulating behaviours for
"a system of governance". 
I think self-discpline is very
similiar to that - expect without somene *else* regulating
your behaviour for you.

[2] There's a research about this,
which supported discpline as supporting
long-term benefits
(you can search the following on Google Scholar):

which supported that decisions from emotions
are at least connected to decisions receiver later by
the same person.
