- Evaluate your own risk profile -

As explained in the game's manual (at the "game structure" part),
investers may evaluate their "risk profile" - how much money
they're willing to risk (out of the money they have), based on
the maximum precentage of their money they think they can lose
without knocking their head against the wall, or something..

Reminder: In this game, your player can be in a 'panic state' by risking close to all
the money your risk profile allows you to, while having at least 2 deposits
with time spans higher than 5 years each.

However, you may think that's stupid. That in real life, investing
all the money you have in 2 long-term deposits won't feel so scary.
That in real life, in that situation, you will never be stressed enough
to even think about asking the bank to release them before their time span is due.

However, many who invest in the stock market may find themselves selling in panic
and losing money[1], simply because they didn't even think they would sell in the panic
despite their "safe" investements in the stock market
(at least "safe" enough for the risk profile they "gave" themselves).

Which could mean, that they didn't evaulate their risk tolerance
well - they can't lose as much as much thought beforehand that they could - 
their risk profile would've better off if it was much lower.

This can happen for many reasons, and one of them which will be addressed right now,
is a cognitive bias (= An irrational thinking anyone may use to infer stuff[2]),
named "Self-serving bias".

It's a bias which causes us to ascrive our success to our own abilities and efforts, 
but ascribe our failure to external factors[3] - things that we have no control of.

We may do this to increase our self esteem and so on, but the point is - 
this bias causes us to belive we'll be big heroes and avoid making irrational
decisions even if we lose all our money.
 
After all, the fate of our invested money
DOES depend on exernal factors, but even if it'll "disappear", who cares,
our self serving bias can make us belive we can withstand lose of any amount of money.

By that is not neccesarily true, and it's unbased -
how can we know how we'll react to something (loss of money),
and predict our behaviour at some unknown point at the future?

So the tip is this:

In this game, don't assume you'll act like a hero
and won't be at a risk to make dumb decisions
every time some event that will make you lose tons of money
(potentially or not) will happen. Be prepared for that,
and when those events happen, do your best to avoid "acting from emotion".

Here's an example:
If, say, you're playing against somene else in multiplayer mode,
and you have many deposits, but then the bank goes bankrupt
in the other player's turn - in your next turn, you might feel
over-mega-super-hyper pissed off.

So, since this made you lose tons of money you could've earned
from the deposits, you might make a dumb decision, like
buying the last deposit the other player had, just to "avenge" him
for causing the bank to release all the deposits it didn't own,
including yours.

But you can still do that for fun, I guess. (-_-)
And you can test yourself by creating your own game,
with your own risk profile.

Anyway, the example brought here will be used in another tip
about self-discpline.

[1] As I explained in a previous tip titled 'Panic State'.

Also, to know when those things happen, you can look at the article
"List of stock market crashes and bear markets" at Wikipedia - 
It has a chart showing many times when the stock market "crashed" - 
which is when those who invest there may sell in panic.

[2] Based on the Wikipedia article about "Cognitive Bias".

[3] Based on the Wikipedia article about "Self-serving bias".

Wikipedia actually gave 2 definitions for self-serving bias,
and what I described was just one of them - 
but I think is the more accarute definition.
