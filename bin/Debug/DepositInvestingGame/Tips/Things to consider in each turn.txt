== TIP ==

- Things to consider in each turn -

Some more factors you may want to take into account before you rush to
buy deposits:

- If I buy the deposit in this turn,
What is the chance that the bank will go bankrupt before this deposit will reach its release time?
(Assuming you buy 0 or 1 or whatever how many you deposits you think you'll buy in the time
this deposit will be locked)

- This one's obvious, but still: How much money I am expected
to earn from this deposit when it will be released?
(That is, if the bank won't go bankrupt and you won't
ask it realease it before its time span is due)

- If the bank does go bankrupt,
how much money will I likely lose?
(Of course you can hardly even guess this,
but still)

- What is the chance that my character will be in 'panic mode'
before the time span of this deposit will be due?
