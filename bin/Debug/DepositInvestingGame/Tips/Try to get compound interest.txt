- Try to get compound interest -

In economics, there's a concept known as "compound interest".

That is basically gaining an interest on another interest
that you gained due to previous investements,
in a current investement.
or in short, "interest on interest"[1].

You also think of this as "money that can make money that can make money" in a potentially infinite loop.

Its meaning is that mathematically, if you invested before X amount of money
on a deposit (which we'll call Y),
and used the interest from the above investement to invest in deposit Y again,
the interest would be higher at the 2nd time.

Here's an example:

Suppose you have 10,000 dollars.

You put them in a deposit for a year that has an interest of 2% per year.

A year later, the deposit is unlocked. The return from the deposit/investement is:

10,000 * 1.02 = 10,200 dollars.

But then you decide to take those 10,200 dollars and invest them,

in the same or identical deposit - 1 year timespan, and an interest of 2% per year.

Then, what will happen?

After **another** 1 year (overall, after 2 years), you'll get:

10,200 * 1.02 = 10,404 dollars.

So, you made 2 identical investements, but one of them earned you 200 dollars (10,200 - 10,000),
but then you "used" those 200 dollars for another investement
that produced 204 dollars (10,404 - 10,200).

In this example, those additional 4 dollars (204-200) are the "compound interest".
Money that you earned from an investement, but also thanks to previous investement/s.

Of course, 4 dollars isn't much for someone who started with 10,000 dollars.
That's only 0.04% (4 / 10,000).

But if you use this trick dozens of times in a row? What if you do this every year for 20 years?

Then, let's just say the compound interest will become a constantly increasing part of
the money the investor gained from all his investements.

Let's say, in the above example, that your income is always 0 dollars a year
(You earn as much as the expenses you have).

So with no investements, after 20 years, you will still have 10,000 dollars.

If you invest all those years the same amount of money,
and thus, not gaining any "compound interest",
after 20 years, you will have:

((10,000 * 0.02*) * 20) + 10,000) = 14,000 dollars.

* (10,000 * 0.02) is the money you will gain from the interest of the investement per year.

And if you constantly invest all your money to earn compound interest every year,
after 20 years, you will have:

(10,000 * 1.02 ^ 20 [that's 1.02 * 1.02 repeated 19 times]) = ~14,860 dollars.

Investing without using investements gave him 4,000 dollars,
while investing using previous investement/s interest/s gave him 4,860 dollars - 
(4,860 / 4,000) = 21.5% more!

(That's while in the previous example, 
the interest was 200 dollars per year while the "compound interest" was only 4 dollars after 2 years,
which means, the compound interest only added (4 / (200 * 2)) = 1% to the overall money (!!!!1111)

This is why money that you invest at the start of this game (when you have little of it)
does have bigger potential with the compound interest - that's an advantage of investing earlier.
The longer the compound interest is used and gained, the more money it produces by itself.

This "trick", by the way, is used not just by induvidualds, but by orgranizations too,
if they use money, they can also invest in however they want.
