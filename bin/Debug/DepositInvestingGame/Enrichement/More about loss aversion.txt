- More about loss aversion -

As you may recall from the tip about 'Panic State',
there's a "psychological phenomenon" called "loss aversion",
about how much we humans hate losing stuff we own[1].

Here I will talk more about how this "loss aversion" causes us to lose money - 
in different situations than when investors sell their securities.

- First, there's an academic article[2],
which argues that while stocks yield
a much higher averge return compared to bonds,
most investors stil seem to prefer to avoid stocks
and invest more (not neccesarily only, but more) in bonds.

It argues that the reasons for that are - 
not only do investors hate lossing money way more
than they want to earn more money (that's loss aversion for ya!),
but they also analyze their investements very frequently,
maybe as if they're planning to invest in the stock market for only 1 year....
(...)
Even if they're actually planning to invest there for dozens of years.

As a result, they may choose less risky investements just so they
won't see any major loses at any year that they're investing at it.
Because while bonds tend to return less money, they're also considered to be
less risky.

This is related to something called "Equity premium puzzle".
I'm not sure what it is, but I think it refers to the same thing[3]..
Or maybe not? Please exuse my stupidity. Go check yourself!

- There's a research[4] done with a simple expirement,
that suggests that people whose's brains may be considered as
suffering from "dysfunction" on some regions of their brains,
may actually invest money better due to their emotions
"not functioning properly"

In the expirement, all patients played a money investement game (like this one),
that consits from 20 rounds of "investement decisions" - like in this game,
in each round, you may choose to invest, and you may choose not to.

And the patients with the "dysfunction" brain in regions related the emotion - 
won. They kicked the ass of those whose brain in the emotional regions was "healthy".

Makes me wonder what "being healthy" actually means..
Maybe their emotions didn't trick them into making dumb decisions,
like you're forced to even you fall into the "panic state" in this game.
I hope your brain is also "dysfunctional" in those "emotional" regions!

- There's also an effect called the "Certainty effect",
which is about the psychological effect of changing
the probability of something from certain to not certain[5].

Some psychologists illustrated this effect with some expirements[5],
which, on the bottom line, showed that people may be willing to make decisions
that are most likely not the most profitable, but the most certain -

decisions that care more about how low the risk of not earning the most money
the decision they make "allows" is, rather than how much money they will
earn from each possible decision "on averge"[5].

So to put it short, because of the above,
some psychologists argue that the more risk (= less certainty)
in a decision, the bigger the "risk aversion"
will have towards that decision[6].

[5] Based on the Wikipedia article about "Certainty effect",
it "refers to the psychological effect resulting from the reduction
of probability from certainty to probable".

The article describes 2 expirements where patients were offered 2 options each time,
one was with a higher chance of earning nothing, but more "averge" profit,
and another with a lower chance of earning nothing, but less "averge" profit.

And in both cases, the patient choosed the less profitable option.
Wikipedia describes it with more deeply.

[6] And yes, I suppose that is unsurprisingly related to "loss aversion" -
the less money we're willing to risk, the more "loss aversion" we have..
