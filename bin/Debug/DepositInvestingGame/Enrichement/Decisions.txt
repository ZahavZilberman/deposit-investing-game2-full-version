- Decisions -

In some previous enrichment,
that refered to placebo and other "bias",
it was explained that your decisions are not irrational.

Now let's explain weird factors that may exist in every
decision making your make:

- Measuring each option against all other compareable options - 
In Dan Ariely's book, "Predictably Irrational", he shows an expirement
in the book's 1st chapter:

You give a bunch of people two situations, in each of them they have to choose
an option. The options were:

Sitaution 1 - 

Option 1: online subscription to a magazine’s website for $59
Option 2: online and print subscription for $125

Situtation 2 - 

Option 1: online subscription to a magazine’s website for $59
Option 2: print subscription for $125
Option 3: online and print subscription for $125

Sine the 2nd option in sitaution 2 is obviously not worth it,
you may think that in both situations, people would equally
choose either the $59 option, or the online and print subscription for $125.

But no! In situtation 1, 68% choose the online and only 32% choose the print subscription,
while in situation 2, 84% choose the third option and only 16% choose the online subscription.

Dan said that this is because the unworthy option (only print subscription for $125)
actually changed the prefference of the other options, because they were measured
in relative to this option as well if it was offered[1].

Stupid options can change our view on worthy options.. -___-!!!

It's like if in this game, you were offered 3 deposits, one with 2% interest
and 2 year time span, another with 3% interest and 1 year time span,
and another one with 2% interest and 1 year time span..
The last deposit obviously isn't worth it, but it may make you prefer
the 2nd deposit (even thought the 1st is actually more profitable..)

- Default options are easier to choose - 
this is already addressed in an old article[2],
but it can be explained better with the Wikipedia article
about "Status quo bias":

When a default option is prsented to a decision,
if you experience (it's an EMOTIONAL bias, after all)
the status quo bias, choosing any option that isn't
the default option will give you a certain feeling of "loss",
and this can lead to prefering the default option,
simply due to loss aversion[4].

By the way, this point was presented and proved
with many examples in a presentation (that is hopefully stil
available in Youtube), that you can check out[3].

A simpe example from that presentation about the status quo bias:

In some countries, people need to sign if they wish to donate organs
post-mortem,
while in others, everyone have to donate organs, and if you don't want to,
you need to sign a form.

And.. In the countries where the default is to donate organs,
about 80-100% of the population do so,
while in the countries where it's not,
0-30% of the population donate organs.

This also applies to this game, in a way - 
you can get lazy and do nothing,
because it's the simpliest (and those, the "default")
decision you can receive at almost every turn,
and it's not bound to your possible loss aversion
(you don't have to lock any money in the bank).

But doing nothing the whole game is the worst possible strategy
for the goal of the game - get as much money as possible as fast as possible.
You need to take risks and invest money!

So.. Those are just some really weird things possibly affecting our decisions.

[1] And if this annying thingy confuses you, you can read
the article on Wikipedia (in english) about "decoy effect" -
that basically presents the conclusion of this expirement.

Dan's conclusion is was also already discussed in an article from 1993,
which you can find in Google Scholar by searching
"Context-Dependent Preferences" (click on the 1st result).

on YouTube. It's a TEDx talk by Yossi Yassour. You may need to put on English subtitles.

and in the enrichment "More about loss aversion".
