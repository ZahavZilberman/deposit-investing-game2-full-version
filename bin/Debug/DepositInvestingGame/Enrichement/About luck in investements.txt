- About luck in investements -

Althought there aren't any "CPI-Linked" deposits in this version of the game[1],

there's something you may want to know about investement that involves investing
in or "against" any index in the stock market.

First, investing "against" an index means to try to "beat the market" - 
to invest and get the money you invest grow more (in percentages)
than the percentage that an index that in the stock market (named "S&P 500")
grows in the same time period - to get a higher yield than that index[2].

In the stock market, funds (which are
"a source of money that will be allocated to a specific purpose"[3])
are sometimes invested in the stock market in ways that 
try to "beat the market".
People who manage them are "active managers"[5].

There are times when they succeed, but based on some expirements[4],
there's a possible suspicion that despite the fact that funds who try to "beat the market"
are managed by "experts",
their succeesses and failures are actually mainly luck-based,
as a "monkey" fund with no strategy at all can beat them a lot..

After all, investing in funds that try to "beat the market" requires paying high prices
compared to other funds (regardless of the price of the bonds and other securities)[5],
and since predicating the future with absloute certainty is appearntly impossible,
many active managers fail to "beat the market".

There's also an investement strategy called "Technical analysis",
in which investors buy and sell certain securities[8], in hope
of predicating currently when each security's price will increase.
And there's research suggesting this strategy is also about as good
as guessing randomly[6].

Once huge risk comes from our (possible) tendency to view free products
as more valueable simply due to their price[7] - 
don't! the price of anything depends on millions of things..
But value is not one of them!

Even if funds with "active" managers or technical investements
could be bought/done for no price, you could still lose money
from those investements themselves..

Hopefully this will help you to be cautious about any investement
that depends on luck (such as cpi-linked deposits, which may exist
in later versions of this game), and avoid evaluating the value of a product
based on its price.

Footnotes:

[1] For expalanation about what a "CPI-Linked" deposit is,
go read the enrichment titled "Deposits" again,
it is explained there.

[2] Based on the Investopedia article about "Is it possible to beat the market?",
which explains what it means to "beat the market".

[3] That's a quote from the Investopedia article about "Fund".

[4] I honestly could'nt think the original titles for the research which points to this,
but by searching on google staff like "stock market monkey beat the fund managers",
some good results refering to those expirements jump!

[5] Based on the Investopedia article about "Active Management".
Relevant quotes:

About price:
"Actively managed funds typically have higher fees than passively managed funds."

And about managers:
"Active management is the use of a human element, such as a single manager,
co-managers or a team of managers, to actively manage a fund's portfolio"

[6] See for example in this research
 Ben R. Marshall, Rochester H. Cahan, Jared Cahan,
"Technical Analysis Around the World", 30.07.2008.

Quote from it:
"Over 5,000 popular technical trading rules are not consistently profitable
in the 49 country indices that comprise the Morgan Stanley Capital Index
once data snooping bias is accounted for".

[7] See in this reseach:
Dan Ariely, Kristina Shampan'er,
"How Small is Zero Price? The True Value of Free Products",
14.12.2006.

It argues that people may actually belive a product has more benefits
simply because it has no price.

That is also related to social norms, which
will be refered to in another tip/enrichment.

[8] According to the Investopedia article about "Securities":
"A security is a fungible, negotiable financial instrument
that holds some type of monetary value."
