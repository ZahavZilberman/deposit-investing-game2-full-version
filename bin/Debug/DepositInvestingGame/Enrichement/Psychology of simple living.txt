- Psychology of simple living -

Let's talk about why to live "simply",

and start by defining "Simple living"[1]:

"encompasses a number of different voluntary practices to simplify one's lifestyle.
These may include, for example, reducing one's possessions,
generally referred to as minimalism, or increasing self-sufficiency.
Simple living may be characterized by individuals being satisfied with what they have rather than want."

However, here's a quote[1] which 'suggests' the meaning of the term
in a far clearer way:

"Simple living is distinct from those living in forced poverty, as it is a voluntary lifestyle choice."

Of course, not all simple living "adherents" neccesarily have expenses low enough to be considered "poor"
by statistics of economic status.
But here I'll talk about simple living as
the adoption of 'simple living concepts' to the point of living in poverty out of choice.

Now, simple living can have many advantages,
other than just saving more money that can be used,
for example, to invest in deposits and make even more money.

Its potential pshychological advantages (compared to not living in poverty)
could be as follows*:

- Less fear of losing what you already have.

When you have something, you also have a fear: Losing it.

You may buy a video game stored in a disc, and feel afraid that the disc will broke,
or buy a house and feel afraid that the house that cost you so much money
will be on fire sometime,
and so on.

Since to live in poverty, you need to buy less staff that is as cheap as possible
(that's the "mindset" of minimalism[1]),
than living in poverty means having less to lose.
Even if you don't have less possesions,
what you DO have costed less money overall,
so you'll proably need less money to 're-gain' all of it.

- Avoiding (or at least "running slower" in) the "rat race" of work and sleep and/or generally wanting
more endlessy.

First, the "rat race" is a name for: "an endless, self-defeating, or pointless pursuit.
It conjures up the image of lab rats racing through a maze to get the "cheese"
much like society racing to get ahead financially.."[2]
(I'll call this "working and sleeping")

And I'll add to it: It may also conjure up the image of a hamster running in a wheel
faster and faster - in endless rounds, as if it's running after it's tail.
(I'll call this "running after your tail")

So now, I'll interept each "image":

a. "working and sleeping" - 

People who work in almost all their waking hours may do so
simple because they live a very expensive lifestyle,
that requires a large income every month to even "survive",
or because they find other value in earning as much as possible
as fast as possible.

As a result, they have to give up their hobbies and possibly
everything they care about other than career and health concerns,
just to keep this lifestyle.[3]

Nethertheless, if you choose to live in poverty, there's proably no need to work so much.

The reason's simple:
1. If you live in poverty, you don't spend money than whatever neccesary to be considered poor.
2. You don't need to earn more money than you spend to survive financially.
3. If you earn less money, chances are (thought not neccesarily), you work less time.

Thus, needing less money is rewarding from this aspect. You can leave more time for relaxtion
and enjoyement.

b. "running after your tails":

This may sound unrelated to minimalism and simple living, but it is.

When a hamster running a wheel continues endlessy, will he ever reach "the end"?
No. His "goal" seems to be himself.
And even then, he'll never even be able to reach his tail.

This demonstrates certain aspects of the lives of humans.

Some psychologists proved we humans have something called "Hedonic treadmill",
which is:
"the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness
despite major positive or negative events or life changes"[4].

While I admit the term "happiness" is pretty vague here, I think the 'message' is clear:
We feel about equally say/happy in most of our lives,
and unique events that change that only make us more happy/sad
for short bursts.

And that's despite not losing (as far as I know) what made us
so happy/sad at those short bursts.

So yeah. We humans may run after staff (some of which can be bought for money)
that makes us happy, get it, become much happier for a short burst, and then feel like nothing special
ever happenned, and as a result, we will want something else for another short burst of happiness.

One of the aspects this can be seen in some of our lives is what I call "buy more":
the will to buy as much as possible to enjoy life as much as possible.

In reality, every purchase may make you happier for an instant.. and that's it.
And even if it does, you will proably immadietly want to purchase something else for another "burst of happiness".

Part of simple living, which is called 'minimalism' (= owing less stuff)[1],
encourages to restrain this rat race - buy as less as possible,
because the happiness it brings is hardly worth anything anyway.

You may even decide that all those things bought for nothing but those
"bursts of happiness" aren't worth any of your money.

- More freedom (free time)

Related to the "working and sleeping" interaption of the rat race -

if you have less expenses, you can work less.

If you work less, you have more free time,
because you not only work less time,
but you also may spend less of your free time consuming stuff
(You know, the time it takes to get to that store..).

Your free time can then be used to pursue other interests,
such as making video games like this one.

- It reduces responsibility.

The less you want, the less you need to take care of what matters to you.
This includes stopping to worry about:

a. How to get it
b. How to use it when you get it
c. How to take care of it after you start using it,
so it won't break or stop working.

All of those responsibilities are what you take upon yourself
when you decide that you want something you currently don't even have.

Which why minimalists who own much less stuff, have much less responsibility.

* Warning: All of those 'advantages' are nothing more than abstract ideas based of nothing
but some deductive and inductive logic and the definition of 'simple living'
I use here (living in poverty out of choice).

Take them in limited liability and not too seriously. They're just my opinion anyway,
and I'm just some random guy who makes cheap text-based video games
to fill the void of my empty life with a false sense of achivement.
