- Bonds -

In the stock market, there's the "bond market"[1].

Bond is a paper that you can buy
(and unlike deposit, you DO need to pay money to buy it,
instead of locking money in it)
and what it gives you is a legal obligation from some organization
to return to you the money you bought the bond with added with an interest[2].

Orgnizations create bonds and sell them to take loans for themselves[2].
You know, just like we as individuals may want to take loans to be able to do stuff,
it's the same for them.

So far, bonds may sound simliar to deposits. But the truth is - 
they are very, very different type of investement.

Bonds are a very complicated investement, so I won't explain them fully,
but here's a bit of what I learned about them (take this in very limited liability):

- As I suggested above, bonds are not issued by banks, unlike deposits.
They may be issued by a national government, a local goverment, companies
and more[7]

- Some bonds are "convertible" to other investement types[2].

- All bonds are ranked with something called "credit rating" or "credit quality"[3], that is meant to hint about
what is chance that the organization will be able to return all the money he is obligated to
when the time span of the bond is due.

- Bonds also may have fixed interest[4], but not neccesarily.
Like with deposits, bonds have various "types" of interests
other than that. Some of which include[7]:

"Floating rate notes" - I think those are the akin to the
"variable rate deposits" - their interest cahnges throught time,
althought the changes are not pre-determined.

"Indexed bonds" - Basically like indexed deposits, I don't know
if there's any difference.

- Bonds always have "yield to maturity", which is, the interest
at the maturity, which is the date in which the issuer of the bond
will have to finish returning all the money for it to its owner while
also paying a fixed interest for it[7].

- Bonds also have a "Market price", which is a number that demonstrates how
much each bond is worth at the moment[7].

So, for example, if a bond you have costed you 100 dollars, and its current
market price is 103 dollars,
you can now sell it for 103 dollars, earning 3 dollars.
But if it's worth less than 100 dollars,
you will lose money if you sell it.

- There are bonds organizations market to the public known as "junk bond"
and some other names. Those are bonds whose "credting rating"
is rather low, althought I'm not sure how low[5].
In either case, their default interests are rather high,
but the chance that the issuer of the bond will fail to return
it and have "Insolvency"[6] is thought to be higher
than any bond whose credit rating is high enough to avoid being
considered a "junk bond".

- Another specific type of bond I can explain is called "Treasury Bill".
Those are bonds issued by national goverments,
that their "maturity" (time span) is less than 1 year,
and unlike some other bonds, they work much like deposits[8]:

They only pay the investor a fixed interest at the "maturity date"
(see "yield to maturity"),
unlike some other bonds, which may pay some types of interests
to the investor **before** the time span of the bond is due.

- And in those other bond types, there's another interest that's called a "Coupon"[7].
The issuer always gives it BEFORE the maturity of the bond,
and he should do it every once in a while - every 1, 6 or 12 months since the bond
is bought.

- There's also a concept about bonds called "bond duration"[9].
I have no idea what that means, but I think it's related to the
interest of the bond, at least if it has a fixed-rate interest,
and to the price of the bond..

- Investing in bonds is associated with various risks[7],
some of which are the same as the risks with deposits.

For example, there's the risk of "insolvency", which is the risk
that the issuer of the bond will not be able (or willing) to return
all the money he is legaly obligated to return to all the investors
who bought the bond, at the maturity date.

Althought, another difference between them and deposits (other than
the forced short time span) is the fact that they can be sold at a higher
price than the price they were bought at.

the ratings BB/Ba, yet according to the Wikipedia article about them, they need
to be below the "investement grade", which is BBB-/BB3.
That's really confusing..
