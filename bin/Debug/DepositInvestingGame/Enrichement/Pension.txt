- Pension -

In this game, you invest money to gain a certain amount of money as fast as possible.

However, investors in real life can have many different reasons for investing in money.
Those reasons may be may have something to do with their investement strategies.

So, now I'll talk about investement strategies people can use in real life to retire from the job market
(leave their jobs and never get another job for the rest of their life),
which is known as becoming finically independent[1], or going into pension

When someone is in pension, he has no income. 
All he buys is with money he earned before going into pension,
which is gathered in a "fund" (an investement)[2].

This is why one who wants to go into pension,
may use some kind of "retirement plan"[2],
to ensure he can retire at a certain age with his money never running out.

The general way to do this, it to create a source of passive income (from investements)
that can be (expected to be)[3] enough to sustain you for the rest of your life.

So if someone were to try this by investing in deposits, he would want
to reach a point where the averge amount of money he earns per month
from nothing but the interests of his deposits is expected to cover all of his (averge)
expenses per month.

However, in real life, he may find that deposits generally offer very little
interests compared to other investement products such as bonds, stocks
and so on.
So one may want to invest in more risky products that generate much higher interest
(more risky from the aspects of the chances that he'll earn less money than he will
if the interests they will give him at the end is what he currently expects),
so he can make a bigger passive income faster.

Anyway, with this, as well as saving money for investements
(by spending less money than he earns),
and then investing that money,
he can retire and go into pension.

For example, say you're 30 years old, have no money saved or invested,
earn a stable income of 2000 dollars per month, spends always 1500
dollars per month, and invests 90% of his savings[4] only in a deposit that has
a time span of 10 years and an interest of 2-3% per year, depending on the amount
of money put into it.

In which case, he saves 450 dollars a month for investements,
so after 10 years, he saved (450 * 12 * 10) = 54,000 dollars.

Then, at the age of 40, he invests 54,000 dollars in a deposit of 10 years with an interest of 2% a year.

By the age of 50, he will save another 54,000 dollars for investements,
while getting the deposit unlocked, thus receiving:
(54,000 * 1.02 ^ 10) = ~65,800 dollars. 
This is (65.8k - 54k = 11,800) dollars he gained from the interest.

Say he adds both of those sums to invest (65,800 + 54,000 = 119,800) dollars
in the same 10-year deposit with an interest of 2% a year.

Then, by the age of 60, he will have:

(119,800 * 1.02 ^ 10) = ~146,000 dollars.

This time, the interest was (146,000 - 119,800 = 26,200) dollars.

Now, say he expects to live until age 80, and wants to go into pension into age 70,
living only from his money. Will he succed? Will the money be enough for 10 years?

Well, first, between the ages of 60 and 70, he'll:

- Earn another 54,000 dollars

- Invest in the same deposit with 146,000 dollars,
meaning by age 70, it'll unlock with (146,000 * 1.02 ^ 10 = ~178,000) dollars.

- So, his sved money, disincluding money from emergency,
is (178,000 + 54,000 = 232,000) dollars by age 70.

Now, let's see if he'll succed. By age 70, he no longer has an income,
still spends 1,500 dollars a month, and doesn't touch his savings for emergency.

Between ages 70-80, he'll spend (1,500 * 12 * 10) = 180,000 dollars.

Reminder: at age 70, after the deposit is unlocked, he had 232,000 dollars saved,
saving for emergency disincluded.

So yes! He'll survive (232,000 > 180,000). Thought if he turns out to live longer, he's in trouble.

That's the basic concept of finicial independence.

However, they are several possible differences between this example and
how it may work for a real life person:

a. In real life, even if you constantly buy the same things and consume equally
every month, your expenses are likely to change throught time,
because of something called "infulation" (and its opposite, deflation)[5]

b. Earning a stable income is not possible.[6]
The guy would have to never loss any of his income sources,
never have their sums change,
which requires stable health, stable relations with his
co-workers/boss/clients, stable location (where he lives),
etc.

c. Remember also that another risk in the above example is the investements
and the reliance on them.
There's no such thing as a safe investement. Investing is like gambling (to some extent).

You know the risks here from the game: The bank may have financial diffculties in returning
to you the money he was supposed to return to you by the time the deposit is released.
Also, you may want the deposit to be unlocked before its time span is due,
resulting in the bank releasing it but mulcting you.
In real life, he may also simply refuse to release your deposit.

The guy in the above example was somewhat lucky to never 'fall' to any of those risks
for 30 years..

d. In real life, there are "retirement ages" that goverments have
for some countries, which can be somewhere between the age 50-80[7].

This is basically a concept the goverment uses to determine when they
expect or require its citizens to retire[7].

The goverment may try to help them by forcing them
to pay some money to the goverment as taxes,
and that money is invested in a fund in the stock market,
and money from that fund can pulled only (or preferably)
after they reach the "retirement age" the goverment stated.

but you make an expection based on the amount of time you're expecting to live,
that can be based on the averge life expectancy in your country and more.

is because some people may suggest to always have some money
left for emergency.
