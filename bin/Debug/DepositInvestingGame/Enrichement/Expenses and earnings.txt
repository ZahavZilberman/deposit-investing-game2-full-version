- Expenses and earnings -

In the game, expenses and earnings are consistent.
You earn and spend the excat same amount of money every month,
every year.

Now, it's worth noting that this is extremely unrealistic.
There's such thing as a "stable" income or spending - even in adult life.
Let's give an example.

Say A is a grown up man that earns money with a job,
and spends money ON various things to get them every month.

This means that A's income and expenses depends on at least all of the following factors:

- His job security. What are his chances not to get fired from the job and from his profession
in the future? [1]

- The business he works for. If something happens to the business and it goes bankrupt
(which can happen to business just like it can happen to any organization), he will lose his job.

- His boss's whims (at his job). Being an employ is much like (althought not identical) to being a slave
since it means working for someone else - and doing work he wants you to do[2] (until you get fired).

- His health. Even the smallest mistake with taking care of A's health can make him go sick,
lose his job and be forced to pay tons of money just to heal.

- The compeition. The job market is competitive - there's no way around it. When you try to
become an employ, you have to convince at least 1 business that you're preferable over the other 20
people who want to get the same job as you (instead of you),
the same as how a business who generally want to make money needs to convince
clients to buy from her instead of the other 100 local businesses that offer the same service[3].
So if the "better" the people at his profession are getting in relative to him,
the more he's likely to lose his job, and to have more diffcult and findining a new job for himself afterwards.

- The offer of the products he buys on a regular basis.
After all, money is used in order to have other people/organizations serve you.
But for that to be even possible, they need to offer their services in the first place.
However, what if they choose to stop giving their services?
If a business he always buys some products from closes, and it can happen,
how will he get those products? Not from that business.

- The propriety of the products he already owns.
If products he uses on a regular basis stop working properly,
he may spend money to have someone else fix them for him,
or fix them himself,
or buy those products again,
or do nothing about it.
In either case, the bottom line is that this can also affect his earnings and (mainly) his spendings.

- The price of any product he buys.
Prices for the same product may vary from one business to another,
and a business may choose to change the price of any of its products.
So, their considerations can also affect A's spendings,
as he may choose to buy the same product from the same business,
if it now costs more or less money than in the previous week.

The bottom line: There's no certainty about expenses or earnings. There are tons of risks about them
flying above all the time.
