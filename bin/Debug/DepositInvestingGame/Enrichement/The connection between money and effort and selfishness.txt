- The connection between money, effort
and selfishness -

Which reason motivates you to work harder - 
earn more money, or earn a nice "thank you",
or earn even more money on your face?

Some research that willingess to earn and keep money
makes us more selfish and more lazy (WTF, indeed):

- In an academic article called "Effort for Payment"[1],
it's argued that there are 2 "types" of markets,
one of which is monetary market (where you work for money),
and the other is "social" market (where you work for status/
friends/recognition).

And according to that article, in the "social" market,
not only the effort people are willling to put for their goals
is "stable" (while in the monetary market, the effort they put
depends on how much they're paid for it), 
but in the "social" market, people tend to be more productive
in that market than in the monetary market.

So yeah, maybe you'd be constantly motivated to play this game
to impress your friend and convince him you'll be an amazing investor 1 day,
but you wouldn't be motivated to play it to actually learn how to invest in deposits
(even thought the game offers a "practical" experience in doing so).

- Another academic article[2] argues seems to argue
that people's desire for money makes them want to do some stuff more alone,
and less willing to help others.. Or whatever makes the article's writers
view those people as more "selfish".

Confused? It's ok. Me too. And I bet those researchers
wrote those articles while feeling more confused than all of us.

This is excatly why I forced myself to add the "multiplayer"
to this game, by the way. Letting someone else chellenge
himself with same thing makes playing this game seem less
selfish. Maybe. Or somethin'.
