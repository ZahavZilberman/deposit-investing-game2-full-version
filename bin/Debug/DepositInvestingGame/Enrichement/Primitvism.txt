- Primitivism -

In this game, expenses don't matter.
Despite that, ther's something about expenses you might not have noticed yet.

We can buy lots of things with money. But how many of them do we actually need?

Let's concentrate on one thing we often use: food, water, shelter and health care. In short,
our physical needs.

Now, you may not agree that all your actual needs are just the physical needs mentioned above,
but even if so,
lets give you a perspective about cheap they can be.

In today's society, you can buy or rent houses that are built based on modern technology,
with prices that can range from thousands to millions of dollars (for buying one of them),
or hundreds to dozens of thousands of dollars per month (to rent one of them).

You may think that since shelter is a basic need, there's no way to avoid paying those prices.
But that's wrong.

It's theoretically largely possible to live in a simple house made out of mud, or even in a cave.
And it costs almost no to no money.

How is it possible? 
Well, assuming that they are few places in the earth where this is legal
(but no matter, why should anyone belive me lol).
Those "houses" can easily be "reformed" if they become ruined.

Plus, keep in mind that:

- Those "houses" are enough to protect you from rain and the sunbeams.

- A cave just has to be found, without being built.
And a house from mud can be made very easily and cheaply comapared to the houses that
are sold/rented with money, because of the simple materials used to built such a house
and its simple design[1].

- Another simple way is to buy a tent (or take one that is given for free),
and live in it in a place where it is legal.

Again, if the shelter is hidden well, the fact that any human who finds it can easily
enter inside wouldn't matter. It does protect from animals and any weather.

What about food and water?
Well, normally, you may pay hundreds of dollars every month just for food and water.

But, you can also[2]:

- Dumpster diving: This means to look for food and water that were thrown to the garbage
despite being fresh[3]. Its risky but possible.

- Grow your own food. You can plant plants that may not require being planted on the ground
(althought it costs a little bit of money).'
If you do it well and wait enough time, the plants will bring fresh food.

- Ask from others.
This is also risky, but only if people will want to harm you just for daring to ask them for food and water.
People and organizations may always have food they don't need with them that they don't mind giving up.

- Water can also be gained from some public drinking taps that may be found in certain public places,
such as a public park[6]

- Water can also be gained from natural resources, like a lake and so on.

So yeah, it's not neccesarily impossible to avoid paying for food and water entirely for dozens of years - 
and still live.

Althought I will admit it is extremely hard -
you will have to live in a place that not only regards the shelter you choose to live in legal,
but it is also close enough to allow you to get the free food sources mentioned above.

But wait, what about health care? How can you take care of yourself without any help
from any doctor or a health fund or pharmacy?
What will you do when you get sick?

Well, I'm not quite sure myself to be honest (althought I do know
there are public bathrooms in public places anyone can use[6]),
so I won't assert that living with no money
without your health getting worse in the long run than it would've if you didn't
is possible in today's world,

But, you can also get access to electricity devices
by going into public places with electrical outlet
aviliabe to the public (a public libary is a possible example),
to gain access to using a phone and/or a computer.
You can then use the interent in that computer to
manage your taxes and your connection with the world.
You can also use websites that offer products for free[6].

And if you live with little or no money, you also do:

- Don't have to experience the stress people may get from their jobs.

- Don't have to contanstly try to satisfy so many people due to your economic dependence on them.
(It can be your family, your aparment's owner if you're renting an aparment,
your boss at your job, etc).

- Immune (or at least far from) to famous distractions modern society creates all the time,
like enteriement products (movies, video games [including this game], etc).
Those things can make you forget other things all day long.

- You decide what you do and when you do it all the time.

So yeah, while living with no money can be very risky to your health,
it doesn't come without stuff that can be advantages to your health,
such as the above sections.

I've heard of people who live in this "primitive" way, or at least assert that they do so.
Google "jon jandai" or "Daniel Suelo"[4] to see for yourself.
I don't know if the stories they tell are real, 
but they sure talk about some intresting "survival techniques".

So to sum this up, you proably don't have to pay much money, if even at all,
for your basic physical needs.
And if you think those are your only actual needs,
then you can live with little to no money on a regular basis.

By the way, I think people who live like that may hold a view called 
"anarcho-primitivism".
This is a view that asserts humanity is better off giving up all the technology
that was developed in the recent 10000 years or so,
and that gaining our food is best done by hunting animals.

This view is just a view, of course.
But some researches do agree that people at those "primitive" times
had (in averge)[5] more free time than the averge person has today.
And if they did, could there be any reason for that other than them wanting less than us?

Afterall, building houses from muds is something that was more common to do thousands
of years ago, when technology was less advanced. People couldn't cook
their food with the complicated machines we use nowdays to do that.
So why not at least consider it possible?

Whatever country you live in may not have some of those "public services"
mentioned in this enrichment, and may have some that weren't mentioned.
Maybe this is worth checking!

Also, remember that living in this "primitivistic" lifestyle means you won't
be able to use any vehicle by yourself, possibly other than public transport,
so you'll have to walk from place to place.
Therfore, you will possibly be better off living near a big city, so that you'll (possibly)
have access to public bathrooms, libaries, taps, etc.
