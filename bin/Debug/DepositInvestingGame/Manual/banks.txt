== Banks and their offers ==

As said in the previous document, this game will focus on loans of banks.

First, the banks generally allow for 2 "types" of loans:

a. Giving a loan to the bank: this is known as "depositing a deposit in a bank".*
b. Taking a loan from the bank.

* Note that in this game, depositing a deposit is considered the same as "buying a deposit"
(because a deposit is like a product offered by the bank).

Option (b) is ignored and doesn't exist in this game, so I won't write about it.

Now about option (a). Here are several things important to know about deposits in general:

- Deposits are NOT loans that you offer to the bank - the bank offers them for you.
What happens is that it presents lists of deposits that you can choose to deposit to the bank.
Each deposit is for a different timespan, and with a different "deafult" interest.

- Deposits are generally not "flexiable" loans.
From the moment you "buy" them in a bank,
they "lock" in there, and are not part of your saved non-used money
(until they are no longer locked).

In the game (in real life it may be slightly different,
depending on the bank) -

and if you insist on "unlocking" them before the time span for
the deposits expires, the bank will agree to unlock
it at that time -
but it will mulct you, althought in this game the
mulct for that is always smaller than the interest you will receive for the deposit.

- In real life, it's possible that in the same bank, there will be 2 different deposits
with the same time span, but different interests.
However, since I have no idea why this happens,
it won't happen in this game.

- The interest of the deposits also depends on the sum of the deposit.
In real life, banks may offer higher interests for every deposit if the deposit's sum
surpasses certain amounts.

In the bank I'm in, for example,
the lowest interest for any deposit is given if the sum is below 50,000 units of money,
the "middle" interest is given to sums between 50,000 - 250,000 units of money,
and the hightest interests are given to sums higher than 250,000 units of money.

- Generally, the banks in real life offer many types of deposits,
and there'll be an enrichment about that later, when you'll advance some more in the game.

But in this game, all deposits are only one type: fixed-rate deposits.

The meaning of a "fixed-rate deposits" is simple: the deposit's interest is measured by the precentage it increases the money
you "bought" the deposit with per year. The precentage is the same for every year.

So, for example, if you "bought" a deposit in 20,000 dollars, its time span is 2 years and it has a fixed interest rate of 1%,
assuming you wait 2 years without ruining the deposit, after 2 years, the amount of money you should receive back (without taxes) is:

20,000 * 1.01 * 1.01 = 20,402 dollars.
