Let's start with loans:

Loan: money that is given to someone with no immediate return
(at the moment it is given), when the borrower (the side GIVEN the loan)
is required to return the money at a time that is predetermined*, with interest.

* The time to return the loan can be predetermined by one of the sides, or both sides,
or a third party.

Interest: Money that is paid to someone for borrowing a loan - 
or, in other words, the price for taking money without giving anything back immediately.

(When someone returns a loan, generally, he must return:

- All the money he borrowed (the loan he was given). This may be called "fund".
- interest for borrowing the money)

Interest rate depends, among other things, on the time span between the time when the borrower
receives the loan, and the time the borrower must should return the entire loan (including interest).
The longer this time span is, the bigger the interest will be.

Interest rate depends also on many other factors,
However, I'm not knowledgeable about them and they're complex,
so most of them will be ignored in this game.

Interest is measured in this game (like in reality) in percentages - 
the interest for a loan will also be expressed in its size compared
to the fund, as it helps to calculate if it's worthy or not.

Anyway, loans can be given to various types of organizations,
including banks, companies, goverments and so on.

This game will focus on the banks.
