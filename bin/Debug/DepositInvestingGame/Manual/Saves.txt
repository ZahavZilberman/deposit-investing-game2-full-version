== Saves ==

- While you're playing a game, you can save your progress in it.

This means you can save a point in the game -

with the "in-game time", your money, your deposits, your mode, etc.

You can open game saves via the main meun.

The same way you save how many scores you want
into the high score table,
you may save as many saves as you want for each game.

When you want to load saved games, due to technical diffculties,
you won't see a save's details before you load it - 
but once you do load it, the game will give you all its general details,
so that you can know if it's the save you were looking for.
