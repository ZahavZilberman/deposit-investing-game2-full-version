== Gameplay - part 2 ==

Let's dig further into the rules:

- You can only buy one deposit (or order the bank to relase a single deposit you have) every whole turn.

- Of course, you only buy a deposit if it belongs to the bank,
and only ask to release one if it belongs to you.

That might sound unrealistic, as in real life, you can buy any deposit you like any time you like.
But even if that's true, in real life, some investors may prefer not to complicate their investement too fast,
so that they'll know what they're doing (as much as they can). That's why it's that way.

- If you already bought a deposit, it will be mentioned
in its details page.
(Its obvious why when you're playing alone. When you're playing against another player or computer,
it means you and him can prevent each other from buying certain deposits by buying them).

- There's also a special case in multiplayer mode:
Normally, you can't do nothing for more than 3 turns in a row.
But if you reach a state where the other player owns all the deposits in the bank board,
then you will be able to do nothing forever (in theory),
since there'll be nothing else you can do.

- In multiplayer mode,
when a deposit of yours is released, whatever because you requested it or not,
it will happen between your and the other player's turns.

- For simplicity, in this game, you are automatically assigned as a client of 1 bank and cannot
become a client of another one unless the current one goes bankrupt.

- If you choose to release a deposit before its time span is due, there are 3 possibilities:

a. The bank will release your deposit and return to you all the money you would've gotten (in theory)
if the deposit's time span would've been due by the time you requested its release,
BUT, it will mulct you and force to you pay some money back to him at that moment as well.

b. same as option (a), expect the bank will also go bankrupt and thus, it will not only mulct you,
but not return to you all the money he "has" to,
other than the money you put 

c. The bank will refuse to release your deposit because the current game date's
is not at any of the deposit's exit point/s (or because the deposit has no exit points,
if its "gap of months" is 0).

Also in multiplayer mode, when this happens, the other player's deposits will be released
with no interest as well.

The possbility that will happen depends entirely on the amount of money the bank has left
(which equals: it's original amount of money minus all the money he payed to all the players
in a game due to the interests of the deposits they bought).

If it runs out when he tries to return all deposits - option (b) will happen.
Otherwise, either option (a) or (c) will happen.

- The amount of the money the bank has at the start of each game, changes between any game,
but must be between 2%-50% than the money players need to earn to finish the game.

- Be carefull not to buy too many deposits with the hightest risk - it will have really bad results.
Your character will go into 'panic state' and you will not be able to choose its actions for a while!
(one of the game's tips which you can unlock explains this fully).

- You will also be notified when:

a. You're in the "panic state",
b. One or more of your deposits's release date has passed,
so the deposit/s has been released (and if the bank went bankrupt).
c. The game's been finished.
d. You unlock a tip/enrichment.
