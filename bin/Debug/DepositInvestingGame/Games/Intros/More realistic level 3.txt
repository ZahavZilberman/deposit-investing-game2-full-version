== Introduction to this test ==

This is like the previous test,
the only difference is in the deposit's interests.
So you'll need a slightly different strategy than
in the previous test.

"Bastard" best score in this test is finishing it at:
year 10, month 7, with 20,500 dollars.

(So you must either finish at "july 10" with over 20,500 dollars,
or finish before that with any amount of dollars).
